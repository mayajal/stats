# This script has been superseded by the Plumber API for web service deployment.
# Please refer to the `backend/alpha-r-plumber-service` directory for the Plumber API implementation.
#
# To run the alpha lattice analysis as a web service, use the Plumber API.
# You can find the Plumber API definition in `backend/alpha-r-plumber-service/plumber.R`.
# Instructions for building and running the Docker container are in `backend/alpha-r-plumber-service/Dockerfile`.
