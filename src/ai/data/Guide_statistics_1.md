# Guide for an AI Chatbot: Selecting Statistical Tools in Agricultural Research

This guide transforms the provided decision tree into a comprehensive, step-by-step knowledge base for an AI chatbot. The aim is to help agricultural scientists identify the most suitable statistical tool for their research, explain when to use each tool, and give practical examples.

## 1. Clarify the Research Objective

- **Ask:** What is the core research question?
    - *Are you comparing treatments, analyzing relationships, or building predictive models?*
- **Define hypotheses:**
    - Null hypothesis (Ho): No effect or no difference.
    - Alternative hypothesis (Ha): Presence of an effect or difference.
- **Example:**
    - *Does a new bio-stimulant increase maize yield under drought?*
        - **Ho:** No yield difference between treated and untreated.
        - **Ha:** Treated outperforms untreated.


## 2. Identify and Classify Variables

- **Dependent variable(s):** The outcome (e.g., crop yield, disease incidence).
- **Independent variable(s):** Predictors or factors (e.g., fertilizer type, irrigation method).


### Levels of Measurement

| Type | Description | Examples |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Nominal | Unordered categories | Crop type, soil type |
| Ordinal | Ordered categories | Disease severity (1-5) |
| Interval/Ratio | Continuous, numerical | Yield (kg/ha), soil pH |

### Assess Data Distribution (for continuous outcomes)

- Does the dependent variable follow a **normal (bell-shaped) distribution**?
    - *Use Shapiro-Wilk test or QQ plot to check.*
- **Normal:** Use parametric tests (t-test, ANOVA).
- **Non-normal:** Use non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis).


## 3. Determine Study Design

### A. Comparing Groups

#### 1. Number of Groups

- **Two groups:** Compare yields from two fertilizers.
- **More than two groups:** Compare multiple varieties/treatments.


#### 2. Sample Type

- **Independent:** Different plots for each treatment.
- **Paired/Dependent:** Same plots measured over time or matched pairs.


#### 3. Choose Statistical Test

| Groups | Sample | Dependent Variable | Normal? | Test | Example |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 2 | Independent | Continuous | Yes | Independent t-test | Yield from 2 fertilizers |
| 2 | Independent | Continuous/Ordinal | No | Mann-Whitney U test | Disease scale in 2 varieties |
| 2 | Independent | Nominal (2 categories) | - | Chi-square (or Fisher’s exact) | Disease present/absent |
| 2 | Paired | Continuous | Yes | Paired t-test | Yield before/after intervention |
| 2 | Paired | Continuous/Ordinal | No | Wilcoxon signed-rank | Paired pest severity ranking |
| 2 | Paired | Nominal (2 categories) | - | McNemar’s test | Disease before/after treatment |
| >2 | Independent | Continuous | Yes | One-way ANOVA | Yields of 3+ fertilizers |
| >2 | Independent | Continuous/Ordinal | No | Kruskal-Wallis | Ordinal pest severity, >2 grps |
| >2 | Paired | Continuous | Yes | Repeated measures ANOVA | Growth at 3 timepoints |
| >2 | Paired | Continuous/Ordinal | No | Friedman test | Ordinal ratings over time |

*For significant ANOVA: run post-hoc tests (Tukey, Bonferroni, LSD) to see which groups differ.*

### B. Analyzing Relationships

| Purpose | Variables | Normal? | Test/Analysis | Example |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Correlation | 2 continuous | Yes | Pearson’s correlation | Soil N vs crop yield |
| Correlation | 2 continuous/ordinal/not normal | No | Spearman’s rank correlation | Temperature vs pest count |
| Prediction | Continuous, 1 predictor | - | Simple linear regression | Yield vs fertilization rate |
| Prediction | Continuous, ≥2 predictors | - | Multiple linear regression | Yield vs pH, water, fertilizer type |
| Prediction | Binary outcome (2 categories) | - | Binary logistic regression | Disease risk: Yes/No |
| Prediction | ≥3 outcome categories | - | Multinomial logistic regression | Soil type: sandy, loamy, clayey |

### C. Advanced Scenarios

| Scenario | Recommended Test | Typical Use |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Multiple outcomes | MANOVA | Yield, height, nutrient all measured |
| Controlling confounders | ANCOVA | Yield difference while adjusting for rainfall |
| Nested/Hierarchical data | Nested ANOVA, Mixed-effects ANOVA | Plots nested in farms, farms in regions |
| Interactions (≥2 factors) | Factorial ANOVA, Mixed-effects ANOVA | Fertilizer type × irrigation method |
| Time series/growth curves | Repeated measures ANOVA, ARIMA | Growth over months; yield trend analysis |
| Multivariate patterns | PCA, CCA, Path/Factor/Disc. Analysis | Identifying key traits in breeding, relationship mapping |

## 4. Interpretation \& Reporting

- **Beyond p-values:** Report effect sizes and confidence intervals.
- **Acknowledge limitations:** Sample size, single season, field conditions, etc.
- **Contextualize:** Compare to existing research. Provide farmer/scientific recommendations.


## Practical Use in Chatbot Interactions

### Example 1: Yield Comparison Between Two Fertilizers

- **User Input:** Compare mean maize yield between Fertilizer A and B (independent plots, normal data).
- **Chatbot:** Use independent t-test.


### Example 2: Effect of Bio-stimulant Before and After Application

- **User Input:** Yield measured on the same plots before and after bio-stimulant.
- **Chatbot:** Use paired t-test (if normal), Wilcoxon signed-rank (if not normal).


### Example 3: Association Between Soil pH and Crop Yield

- **User Input:** Want to see if there is a relationship.
- **Chatbot:** Use Pearson correlation (if both variables are continuous and normal); else use Spearman correlation.


### Example 4: Predict Disease Risk

- **User Input:** Predict disease/no disease using rainfall and variety.
- **Chatbot:** Use binary logistic regression.


## Key Reminders for Chatbot Guidance

- Always clarify the research question and data structure.
- Guide users to identify variable types and data distribution.
- Suggest appropriate statistical tests, with brief reasoning.
- Provide practical advice on reporting results and potential study limitations.
- For complex/nested designs or uncertainty, recommend consulting with a statistician.

This guide forms a structured knowledge base for an AI chatbot, ensuring agricultural scientists receive precise, context-appropriate, and actionable guidance on selecting and applying statistical tools in their research[^1].
