# FAQ Document

## 1. **How do I choose the right experimental design for my field trial?**

- The best design depends on your field conditions and objectives.
- **Randomized Block Design (RBD):** Use when your field has variation (like different soil types). RBD groups similar units (blocks), then randomizes treatments within each block.
- **Completely Randomized Design (CRD):** Use when conditions are very uniform—treatments are randomly assigned without grouping.
- For most agricultural fields with non-uniformity, RBD is usually preferred.

## 2. **How do I determine the correct sample size and number of replications?**

- **Replications** ensure reliability of results and help estimate experimental error.
- More replications reduce the chance of false results due to random variation.
- **Degrees of freedom** relate to how many independent pieces of information your experiment provides—more replications increase degrees of freedom.
- Calculate sample size based on expected differences, variability in your data, and the level of statistical confidence desired.
- If unsure, aim for at least 3 replications per treatment in field experiments.

## 3. **Which statistical test should I use for my agricultural data?**

- **ANOVA:** Use when comparing means across 3 or more groups/treatments.
    - **One-way ANOVA:** Only one factor is studied (e.g., effect of fertilizer type).
    - **Two-way ANOVA:** Two factors (e.g., fertilizer and variety), and their interaction.
- **t-test:** Use when comparing means between just 2 groups.
- **Non-parametric tests** (like Kruskal-Wallis) are suitable if your data is not normally distributed.
- **ANCOVA/MANOVA:** Use for more complex designs involving covariates or multiple dependent variables.

## 4. **How do I handle missing data and unbalanced designs in field experiments?**

- **Try to avoid missing data** by careful planning and monitoring, but sometimes it's unavoidable (e.g., crop loss).
- Methods for handling missing data:
    - Leave blank and use statistical techniques that adjust for it (such as least squares).
    - Replace with average of other similar values (for a small amount of missing data).
- **Unbalanced designs** can often still be analyzed, but ensure your statistical method (like ANOVA) can handle unequal group sizes.

## 5. **How do I interpret and report statistical results for publication?**

- **P-value:** Shows if results are likely due to chance. A **p-value less than 0.05** is usually considered statistically significant (real effect).
- Always state the exact p-value in your report, not just “significant” or “non-significant.”
- Present key statistics (like mean, standard error), explain your design, and describe how results answer your research questions.
- Use clear tables and figures to support your findings.
